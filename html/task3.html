    <div class="text-white-50 fs-4">
      <p>BUV's learning management system (Canvas) is deemed inefficient because of its faulty system for student education and growth.The existing system possesses four significant drawbacks that impede users from achieving their learning objectives: an inadequate interface, unnecessary features, an ineffective submission process, and an outdated communication system. There is no doubt that these challenges have considerable bearing on student involvement and inspiration, consequently leading to a poorer level of efficiency and academic achievement of BUV. The ideal LMS should aim to overcome these challenges to cater to the learning needs of students and create a new platform that can facilitate their educational and personal growth. The new UI should be designed with the user's needs in mind, including clear navigation and organization of content, visually appealing graphics, and customizable options, such as the ability to adjust font size, color scheme, and layout. In addition, the system should be able to support a variety of actions, including the implementation of a real-time messaging system for direct communication between instructors and students, the creation of discussion forums for collaborative learning and problem-solving, and the provision of notifications for new messages and replies. User testing should be conducted annually to gather feedback and identify pain points. Therefore, we can regularly eliminate unnecessary features and maintain the interface to ensure optimal performance.
