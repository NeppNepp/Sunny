                <p class="fs-4" style="text-align: justify;">Canvas provides several advanced capabilities of an LMS, including diverse learning material formats, such as video, and files, as well as the option to employ quizzes as either assessments or learning materials. Furthermore, Canvas offers web conferencing, complete with screen-sharing, recording, and replay features. However, students have access to learning resources for their registered courses for only one semester. Functions such as discussion boards and online conferences necessitate authorization for access. This LMS should offer unlimited access to all the learning materials for the courses they are registered for, as well as the ability to send messages to any user on the platform. Hosting online conferences should not require permission from an administrator and should be accessible to every user with the support of document-sharing and third-party tools <br>

                    In contrast, Duolingo does not allow users to upload files. Instead, it provides a collection of learning materials, including mini-games and interactive/audio lessons, and guild mechanics to facilitate self-learning. Additionally, Duolingo lacks support for online conferences and discussion forums. Some suggestions for improving this site include improving communication between students and teachers and giving teachers more flexibility in structuring their sessions.<br>
                    
                    Text-based resources, videos, audio, quizzes, and other learning tools are all supported by TalentLMS. The platform is designed to allow easy sharing of course structures within a group and is accessible for students to review past courses. TalentLMS features a user-friendly discussion area and supports various learning methods (peer-to-peer learning, collaborative projects). However, as the complexity and number of users expand, the platform's performance may suffer. Besides providing high-quality virtual classrooms with beneficial functions, namely: scheduling, taking notes, and recording, what sets TalentLMS apart from other LMSs is its ability to incorporate third-party tools. This feature allows for the creation of separate discussion areas for each mini-course, which can help enhance users' concentration. In order to improve the user participation experience of TalentLMS, its discussion area needs to be able to adapt and handle bigger volumes and more complicated discussions.</p>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">Date and time / Arthour name</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="fs-4" style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to tracking user participation, Canvas LMS has some limitations. While it does send reminders to students about upcoming assessments, new course materials, and grades, this information is only available within the course menu, not on the home page. Additionally, Canvas does not offer any means of attendance tracking. An ideal LMS should have an effective user participation tracking system that sends notifications and reminders about critical events like new learning materials, student tasks and assessments, new courses, and grades. The notifications and reminders should be customizable and easily accessible on the homepage. <br>
                    In contrast, Duolingo's attendance and progress monitoring features are highly accurate and reliable. This is due in large part to the well-designed lessons for each topic, which provide a clear indication of the student's performance. Furthermore, the platform includes a reminder system that provides daily feedback on student achievement and alerts them if they have not made any progress in a long time. Yet, there may be issues with the notification and reminder system, as it can sometimes send an excessive amount of notifications to the user. Both the notification and reminder system use the same method of delivery to the user, which can potentially lead to confusion or misunderstandings. Decreasing the frequency of reminder system notifications could be a solution to address this issue. <br>
                    TalentLMS offers the flexibility to personalize notifications and reminders according to the specific needs of individuals and groups. Notifications can be sent via multiple platforms, such as email, SMS, and mobile apps, and are automatically scheduled and sent. The platform also features multiple forms of progress and attendance tracking, such as login/completion/progress/quiz tracking, though sometimes tracking mistakes may occur due to network issues or human errors. Some suggestions for improving are to integrate multi-layer tracking and limit the number and timeframe of notifications.</p>
