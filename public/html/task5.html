            <p class="fs-4" style="text-align: justify;">
                Based on three rounds of usability testing conducted with BUV students, we have gathered valuable feedback and identified issues in our approach to developing the new LMS. This report aims to evaluate our low-fidelity prototype based on five key metrics derived from user testing, allowing us to understand its strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, we will present a set of actionable recommendations to tackle the identified issues highlighted during our analysis.<br>
As can be seen from the table, it is evident that the Success rate achieved a perfect score of 100%, indicating that all users who participated in the usability testing successfully completed the task. This result reflects the users' ability to navigate and interact with our new system, without encountering significant difficulties or errors. The user-customizable function was found to be user-friendly and intuitive, with all three participants able to navigate it easily and complete tasks in under 10 seconds. Moreover, there were no reported instances of errors or usability problems. These findings indicate excellent usability and a positive user experience, demonstrating that users were able to complete tasks accurately and efficiently without encountering significant errors or confusion. Our prototype also includes a pop-up preview function that displays the content of the slide when the user hovers over the link. This feature received positive feedback during the usability testing, with all participants appreciating its usefulness. Furthermore, there were no reported errors or usability problems associated with this function, which suggests decent usability and user experience. <br>

On the other hand, the usability testing revealed some issues that need to be addressed, as indicated by the five metrics. The first problem identified was related to the Comment function. All participants were confused by the functionality of the "Add a new comment" button, mistakenly assuming that it would open a textbox for them to enter their comments.  This was the only reported error during the user testing phase. The second issue exists in our new Discussion function. The reported number of Time on task metrics for three primary forum functions—View Thread, Comment a thread, and Post thread—yielded excellent results, with all participants completing the tasks within the expected timeframe. However, an issue arises when users are within a specific thread window and wish to return to the forum's homepage. There is a leftwards arrow symbol that lacks the functionality to navigate back to the homepage. Instead, users must click on the word "discussion" to return.
In order to address the identified issues and enhance the user experience of our solution, we have compiled a table of actions to be taken. Each action has been carefully considered based on the feedback and insights gathered from the usability testing and user interviews

                        However, its actual purpose is to directly post their comment on the content.

                         2.	Make visual enhancements to the button to make it stand out and differentiate it from other elements on the interface. Use color, size, or placement strategically to draw attention and indicate its purpose.

                    <td>In order to enhance the functionality of the feature, we recommend incorporating additional details into the pop-up preview, including the file's date, description, and learning objectives of the corresponding materials. <br>
                        By incorporating these additional elements, users will have a more comprehensive understanding of the content before accessing it.
